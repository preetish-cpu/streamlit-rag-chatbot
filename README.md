** Project Overview **
This project is a specialized chatbot designed to assist judges during a hackathon. It utilizes a powerful technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and relevant information. Instead of relying solely on a pre-trained language model, the assistant is able to analyze and answer questions about specific documents, such as project proposals or PDFs uploaded by participants.
